    <h1>Faisalabad - The Manchester of Pakistan</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      According to the latest census of 2017, Faisalabad with a population of
      3.2 million is the third largest city in Pakistan, biggest being Karachi
      and Lahore on the second place. But it is amazing to know that just a
      little over a century ago this city did not exist at all. Indeed
      Faisalabad is one of the youngest cities of Pakistan. . The total area of
      Faisalabad District is 5,856 km2 (2,261 sq mi)[6] while the area
      controlled by the Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA) is 1,280 km2 (490
      sq mi).[7][8]:8 <br />
      has grown to become a major industrial and distribution centre because of
      its central location in the region and connecting roads, rails, and air
      transportation.[9] It has been referred to as the "Manchester of
      Pakistan".[10][11] As of 2013, GDP (PPP) of Faisalabad was estimated as
      $43 billion[4] and projected to rise to $87 billion in 2025 at a growth
      rate of 5.7%.[12] Faisalabad contributes over 20 percent to the Punjab's
      GDP and has an average annual GDP (nominal) of $20.5 billion.[4]
      Agriculture and industry remain its hallmark.[13][8]:41
